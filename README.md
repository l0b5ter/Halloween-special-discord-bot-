## Code is now out!!!!!
Regarding the code to make it work and all that..
Packages which must be installed to get it to work.
  1. npm Schedule
  
thats all the packages required, now so usefull knowledge.
take a goooooood look in the config.json before doing anything, it goood everything you need to modify to work it as you want.
Want to remove or add more pics? name the pics numbers and place them into the pics folder, then in the config.json you see something named PicArray this is the last number on your pic in the folder.
intervall is in milliseconds btw.

Ok ok, i think you can figure out the rest, so good luck and dont be afraid to ask me^^
